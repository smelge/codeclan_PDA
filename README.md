### Cognitive test revision notes 

These are all the notes needed as part of the revision for the cognitive tests. Students should use these resources to revise for the tests.

IMPORTANT: Students will complete these tests under exam conditions at a set point in the course. You will be advised by the instructors at what point these will be completed. These resources do not have to be read until indicated by the instructors.

### PDA lessons

These are the lessons that give guidance on various diagrams (formatting, minimum requirements, etc.). Use these to help guide what evidence you should use and how to format various diagrams, etc. 

### Policies and Procedures

These are the documents that must be read by the student in order to agree with processes that the Professional Development Award follows. None of these documents need to be printed or completed by the student, just read.

### Student Checklist

This is an electronic copy of the checklist that is handed out to students over the 16 week course as part of the evidence gathering that is required. Use these document to record your evidence and save it in your own PDA repo.
